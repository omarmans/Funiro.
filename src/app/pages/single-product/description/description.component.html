    Embodying the raw, wayward spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, the Kilburn portable
    active stereo speaker takes the unmistakable look and sound of Marshall,
    unplugs the chords, and takes the show on the road.

    Weighing in under 7 pounds, the Kilburn is a lightweight piece of vintage
    styled engineering. Setting the bar as one of the loudest speakers in its
    class, the Kilburn is a compact, stout-hearted hero with a well-balanced
    audio which boasts a clear midrange and extended highs for a sound that is
    both articulate and pronounced. The analogue knobs allow you to fine tune
    the controls to your personal preferences while the guitar-influenced
    leather strap enables easy and stylish travel.
